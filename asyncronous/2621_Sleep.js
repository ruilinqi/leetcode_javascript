/**
 * 
 * Write an asyncronous function that accepts a positive integer millis and sleeps for that many 
 * milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

Example 1:

Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});


Example 2:

Input: millis = 200
Output: 200
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.
